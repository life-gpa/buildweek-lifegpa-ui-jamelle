        <h3 class="">How does LifeGPA work?</h3>
        <p class="">In the same way that your professors and instructors give you a grade to evaluate your progress or success in their course, LifeGPA similarly uses a score to evaluate your success during the entirety of your life thus far.</p>

        <h3 class="">OK, great--how do you guys get that score??</h3>
        <p class="">Your LifeGPA is a number that shows the level of achievement you reached in any given focus area throughout the year. Your LifeGPA scores can go up and down over time and will change according to how much you improve your overall level of achievement (or, in some cases, how much you fell behind).</p>

        <h3 class="">How do I keep a high LifeGPA?</h3>
        <p class="">Maintaining a high LifeGPA isnâ€™t always easy; and if you start with a low LifeGPA at the beginning of your life, it is much harder to raise your LifeGPA later on (thanks, social constructs).</p> 
        <p>Your LifeGPA will change and vary throughout the years; but having in mind what your LifeGPA is every year will give you a good indication of how well you are doing in your life overall (and perhaps, whether you need to improve).</p>
