        <h3 class="">How does LifeGPA work?</h3>
        <p class="">In the same way that your professors and instructors give you a grade to evaluate your progress or
          success in their course, LifeGPA similarly uses a score to evaluate your success during the entirety of your
          life thus far.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 class="">OK, great--how do you guys get that score??</h3>
        <p class="">Your LifeGPA is a number that shows the level of achievement you reached in any given focus area
          throughout the year. Your LifeGPA scores can go up and down over time and will change according to how much
          you improve your overall level of achievement (or, in some cases, how much you fell behind).</p>

      <section>
        <h3 class="">How do I keep a high LifeGPA?</h3>
        <p class="">Maintaining a high LifeGPA isn’t always easy; and if you start with a low LifeGPA at the beginning
          of your life, it is much harder to raise your LifeGPA later on (thanks, social constructs).</p>
        <p>Your LifeGPA will change and vary throughout the years; but having in mind what your LifeGPA is every year
          will give you a good indication of how well you are doing in your life overall (and perhaps, whether you need
          to improve).</p>

        <p class="date">(Seriously.)</p>
        <p>Let us keep a diary of your life to help you understand your habits and increase your likelihood of hitting your goals. Improving your life isn't one-size-fits-all and not everyone has the same goal. LifeGPA meets you where you are.

        <h2>Results in real-time</h2>
        <p class="date">Stay motivated</p>
        <p>Study after study has confirmed the benefits of keeping track of the decisions you make and the impact it has on your life. It's simple,  the more consistently you track your life, the more likely you are to make significant improvements. That's why every successful person suggests that you keep a life diary and/or an activity log. But recording everything you do without the right tools can be tedious at best, or simply impossible at worst.</p>
